# UW frontend refactoring

This project has been intentionally badly written with numerous bugs, bad decisions, code smells and inconsistencies.

It displays a list of people from the StarWars API (SWAPI). For each item it should show:
- Their name
- Their birth date in the original "BBY" format returned from the SWAPI
- The year of their birth extracted from the birth date
- Whether their birth year is an even or odd number


## Challenge
Identify, discuss and fix the issues you can see in the code. Feel free to ask questions and collaborate.
